# Snippet anatomy

Every snippet is a plain ES module (`.ts` file) with two exports: `meta` and `run`.

## Shape

```ts
export const meta = {
  description: 'One-line summary used by the retrieval index',
  preconditions: {
    url: /github\.com\/.+\/pull\/\d+/,    // RegExp or string-pattern matched against page.url()
    visible: 'Leave a comment',           // string or string[] — text(s) that must be visible
  },
  args: { gifPath: 'string', prUrl: 'string' },
  tags: ['github', 'pr', 'upload'],
}

export async function run(page, args) {
  // page is a Playwright Page already attached over CDP to the user's live session.
  // Whatever you return is included in the registry's invoke output.
}
```

## Fields

- **`description`** — single line, used verbatim in `INDEX.md`. Make it specific enough that Claude can pick this snippet over a similar one without reading the body. The index parser extracts this with a regex against the first `description: '...'` line in `meta`, so keep it on one line and use single/double/backtick quotes (no template interpolation).

- **`preconditions`** — checked *before* `run()` is called. Two keys supported today:
  - `url`: a `RegExp` (or string pattern) tested against `page.url()`. Use this whenever the snippet only makes sense on certain pages.
  - `visible`: a string or array of strings. Each must be visible on the page (Playwright's `getByText(...).first().isVisible()`). Catches "user isn't logged in" or "modal hasn't opened yet" before selector errors leak out three steps deep.

  Missing preconditions are fine — but in that case the snippet is responsible for self-checking. Prefer to declare them so failures surface as `precondition` rather than `run` errors.

- **`args`** — informational only today. A `{name: typeName}` map that Claude reads to know what to pass. Not enforced at runtime; if a future step adds schema validation, this is where it'll live.

- **`tags`** — optional, for future retrieval / filtering. Not used by the bare registry.

## `run(page, args)`

- `page` is the Playwright `Page` from the active `forge` playwright-cli session. The browser is *shared* — don't close it, don't navigate away from work the user has in flight unless that's the whole point of the snippet.
- `args` is whatever the caller passed (parsed JSON). The snippet is responsible for its own arg validation today.
- Throw on unrecoverable errors. The registry catches and records as an `invoke-failed` history event.
- Return whatever's useful to the caller — a `result` field in the invocation output. Returning `undefined` is fine.

## ⚠️ run-code constraints

The `run()` body is extracted at invocation time and run inside `playwright-cli -s=forge run-code "async page => { ... }"`. That sandbox provides `page` and JS built-ins — nothing else.

- ❌ No `import` statements. They will fail at run-code time.
- ❌ No `require()`.
- ❌ No references to other top-level functions in the file — only the body inside `run`'s braces survives extraction.
- ✅ Local helper functions defined *inside* `run`'s body are fine.
- ✅ Plain `async`/`await`, control flow, regex, JSON, `Math`, `Date`, `process.env.NAME`.
- ✅ The full Playwright `page` API.

## Conventions

- **No top-level side effects.** Importing the snippet must be cheap and pure (the registry imports it just to read meta and stringify `run`).
- **No `import` of test runners** (`@playwright/test`). Use plain Playwright API on `page` only.
- **Credentials never live in args defaults or top-level constants.** Pass through `process.env` for secrets; declare the env-var name in `meta.args` as `"env:NAME"`.

## Where snippets live

- `scratch/` — newly authored or one-off. 7d TTL.
- `staged/` — promoted on second successful use.
- `library/` — promoted on third successful use; never auto-deleted.
- `broken/` — quarantined after a failed repair. Don't invoke from here.

Promotion happens automatically based on `useCount` in `stats.json`. You can also move snippets between tiers with `mv`; editing the file in place is fine — the registry re-reads on every invocation.

## Who writes snippets

The `forge:author` agent. It runs automatically after every drive that goes through the driver agent, reads the session transcript, and decides which chunks of work are worth saving. You don't author snippets by hand in normal use — though you can: just write a `.ts` matching the shape above into `scratch/` and run `forge-registry.mjs reindex`.
